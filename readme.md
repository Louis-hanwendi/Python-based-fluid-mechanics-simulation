# Mechanics Simulation 🌊

A 2D fluid dynamics simulation using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This project allows users to interactively simulate fluid behavior such as diffusion, advection, and pressure projection in real-time. 🚀

## Features
- Real-time fluid simulation with interactive mouse input 🎨
- Visualization of fluid density and velocity fields 📊
- Implementation of diffusion, advection, and pressure projection algorithms 🧪
- Easy-to-use graphical interface for adding density and velocity sources 🖱️
