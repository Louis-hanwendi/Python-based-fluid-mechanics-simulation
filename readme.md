This Python script is a fluid simulation program that visualizes the behavior of a fluid (such as smoke or water) in a 2D grid environment. The script uses numerical methods to simulate fluid dynamics, including diffusion, advection, and pressure projection, and it allows for interactive user input via mouse movements to dynamically influence the fluid flow.
