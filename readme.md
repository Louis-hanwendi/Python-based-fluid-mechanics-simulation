# Mechanics Simulation 🌊

A 2D fluid dynamics simulation using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This project allows users to interactively simulate fluid behavior such as diffusion, advection, and pressure projection in real-time. 🚀

## Features
- Real-time fluid simulation with interactive mouse input 🎨
- Visualization of fluid density and velocity fields 📊
- Implementation of diffusion, advection, and pressure projection algorithms 🧪
- Easy-to-use graphical interface for adding density and velocity sources 🖱️

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x 🐍
- NumPy 📈
- Matplotlib 🎨

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mechanics_simulation.git
   ```
   ### and
   ```bash
   cd mechanics_simulation
### Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

```
### Run the simulation:
```bash
python mechanics simulation.py
```
## Usage
Adding Density: Press and hold the mouse button to add density to the fluid. 🖱️
Adding Velocity: Move the mouse while holding the button to add velocity in the direction of movement. 🚀
Diffusion: The fluid will naturally diffuse over time. 🌀
Advection: The fluid will move based on the velocity field. 🌬️
